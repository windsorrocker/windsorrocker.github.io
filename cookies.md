# Cookies

Like many small businesses, we use Google Analytics to work out how this site works and to help improve it for our visitors. In order to use Google Analytics, we have to store a cookie. 

So what is a cookie? Cookies are tiny files of information that a web server generates and sends to a web browser. Web browsers store, on your computer or mobile phone, the cookies they receive for a predetermined period of time, or for the length of your session on a website. Your browser will attach the relevant cookies to any future request you make from the web server. They can be annoying because these cookies can be used to store all sorts of information about you that you probably wouldn't want to give. We do not do that and have striven to keep everything minimal!

Google won't let us store their cookie unless we store a cookie that tells us that you have given permission to store any cookies and so it grows.

If you have already clicked the "Approve" in a black band that might have appeared at the bottom of our pages then you have given us permission to store cookies. If that band still appears, you can continue to read our site (and maybe even purchase a Windsor Rocker) but things might not work quite so well as we would have hoped.

We use the Ecosia web search engine because they [plant trees](https://www.ecosia.org/){:target=new} and we should all support that!
