# Delivery & returns

We offer free delivery to most parts of the UK with a specialist art delivery company. They have scheduled weekly runs which collect from us one week and deliver the following with the day of the week depending on your location. This means that if we have the piece you are looking for in stock then this can be with you within two weeks. If the piece is not in stock then it will need to be made to order which can take up to 10 weeks. For orders to areas further afield there will be an additional delivery charge and the time schedule will need to be confirmed when the order is placed. 

During the first 30 days after delivery, if, for any reason, you are not totally delighted with your Windsor Rocker and it is made with one of our standard woods and finishes, please contact us so that we may talk to you about this. If you would like to return your Windsor Rocker then we will arrange for it to be collected (again using our specialist delivery company) and the cost of this will be deducted from your refund. Refunds will only be made for pieces that have no signs of use and are returned in all of their original packaging.

We do not offer refunds for bespoke versions of the Windsor Rocker that have been made to order.
