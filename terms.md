**"Us"**, **"we"** and **"our"** refer to The Windsor Rocker Company.

## Pricing & payment

Prices charged will be our current price on the day on which the order is placed unless otherwise stated in writing by us. We reserve the right to change our prices at any time without prior notification.

We offer a 20% discount to trade buyers and a 10% discount to [Woodland Heritage](https://www.woodlandheritage.org/join-us){:target="-new"} members.

If we supply a quote containing prices which are different from our list price then this price is valid for 30 days from the date of the quotation.

For non-stock (bespoke) items a non-refundable 50% deposit is payable with order and the balance received in full for all orders prior to delivery.

Where your Windsor Rocker has been ordered to a bespoke specification, it is your responsibility to verify that this specification is correct as outlined in the invoice provided by us prior to your making the deposit payment.

Are invoices all include VAT. We are registered for UK VAT with registration number 644 6602 36.

## Non-payment

Should you pay any initial invoice, either for a bespoke specification or for an out of stock item, but then fail to pay any balance due before delivery within 30 days of our invoicing you for that balance, we will cancel the order and will retain the original payment that has been received. Should you wish to resume your order within six months of original invoice payment then we will immediately invoice you for the balance but will not resume manufacture of your Windsor Rocker until payment has been received in full.

## Cancellation

If you wish to cancel any order before we have arranged shipping, we will refund you the full amount paid. If your order is for a bespoke specification or for an out of stock item then we will only refund you the full amount paid to date if we have not started manufacture of your Windsor Rocker.

We strongly advise you to contact us as soon as decide to cancel and we will do everything we can to accommodate your change of mind, regardless of the circumstance.

## Delivery & Lead Times

We will make all reasonable efforts to deliver our Windsor Rockers within the period stated in our invoice. We will not have any liability for any delay in delivery.
 
An order will only be considered placed once either payment has been made in full for an in-stock item or, for bespoke versions or pieces out of stock at the time of order, that a 50% deposit has been received.

The risk of loss or damage to any Windsor Rocker passes to you upon delivery. 

## Returns

Although we have never had a return, we do understand that sometimes things can go wrong and so we ask you to inspect your Windsor Rocker upon delivery. If you find any defect you must notify us in writing within ten working days from the delivery date. If requested, you will supply us with adequate images of the defect so that we can assess it carefully.

If we agree that there could, subject to a physical examination, be a defect we will ask you to carefully pack the Windsor Rocker, ideally in the original packaging, so that we can arrange collection by our delivery company.

When it has been returned to us we will carefully inspect it and will contact you to tell you our findings.

1. If we disagree that there is a defect and cannot find any damage from transit and you would like to keep it, we will invoice you for the delivery costs from you to us and from us back to you. We will wait until you have paid this in full before arranging delivery back to you.
1. If you do not want to keep it, we will refund you the original cost as invoiced less the cost of delivery to you and from you back to us providing the chair is in its original condition.
1. If we disagree that there is any defect or damage but you would like to swap the Windsor Rocker for an alternate, we will, providing the returned chair is in the same condition as it was when it originally left us, invoice you for the delivery costs from you to us and from us back to you. We will wait until you have paid this in full before arranging delivery of the replacement Windsor Rocker to you.
1. If we agree that there is a defect or that the Windsor Rocker has been damaged in transit and you want a replacement, we will organise this as soon as possible. Should we be out of stock, there might be a delay in getting this to you.
1. If we do agree that there is a defect or damage from transit and you do not want a replacement, we will refund you in full the amount originally invoiced.

## Warranty

Pieces are hand-made from natural materials. Although care is made in selection we cannot warrant that materials, texture and finishes exactly match any image or specification.

We warrant that all items will be free of errors in workmanship and will contact you to discuss repair or replacement if you have notified us within 10 working days of delivery.

We provide no additional warranty on delivery or shipping over that offered by the shipper used - details of which are available on request prior to shipping.

There is no warranty on any Windsor Rocker shipped outside the UK but we expect that damage in transit would be covered by the delivery company involved.
